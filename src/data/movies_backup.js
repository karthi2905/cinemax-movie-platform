Traveling for nearly three years after his mother's death, Kurt is back to reconcile with his father Kenneth (Bill Humphreys) and brother Elijah (Jeff Fritz). But his plans are quickly derailed when he befriends Dwayne (Jerry Howe), a benevolent comrade of the town misfits. Over a game of cards, Kurt meets Eddie (Michael Walsh), a deadbeat dad hiding from gambling debts, and Seamus (Matt Magennis), an antisocial pack rat withdrawn from the world around him. Together, the four characters form an uncompromising fellowship that pushes them into the fringes of society. This is a stirring and complex vision wrapped in breathtaking scenery.",

    "synopsis": "Examines the status and plight of Palestinians after the Oslo peace process, discussing and documenting situations in which things have gotten worse for refugees, rather than better. The checkpoints at various locations (access to highways, exiting and entering a city or an area under putative Palestinian control, and access to holy sites) become the symbol of Israel's post-Oslo apartheid. The film also argues that, in the islands of Palestinian autonomy that make up three percent of Israel's land, Arab self-determination is virtually non-existent.",

    "synopsis": "Monsieur Feydeau has writer's block, and he needs a new play. But he takes an opportunity to observe the upper class of 1900 Paris - Monsieur Boniface with a domineering wife, and the next-door neglectful husband Henri with a beautiful but ignored wife Marcelle. Henri traces architectural anomalies (most ghost sounds are drains), and plans a night at the Hotel Paradiso; but this hotel is the assignation spot of Marcelle and Boniface. One wife, two husbands, a nephew, and the perky Boniface maid, all at this 'by the hour' hotel, and consummation of the affair is, to say the least, severely compromised (not the least by a police raid). All of this under Feydeau's eye, and his play is the 'success fou' of the next season. 1900. Engineer Benedict Boniface is the henpecked husband of overbearing Angelique Boniface. Marcelle Cot feels neglected by her structural architect husband, Henri Cot. The Bonifaces and the Cots live in the same residential enclave in suburban Paris. On the occasion of Mme. Boniface heading off on an overnight trip to spend some time with her ailing sister and M. Cot having an overnight business trip in the city to inspect a hotel out of which mysterious, unexplained noises are emanating in the middle of the night, M. Boniface takes the opportunity to confess to Marcelle that he is attracted to her, in the hopes that she feels the same about him, and that she would be amenable to having an affair while their respective spouses are away. She is on both counts. M. Boniface believes the place they should go is the Hotel Paradiso, which has been slyly advertising without the authorities' knowledge that it is not averse to renting rooms \"by the hour\". The hotel is operated by Anniello, who, with the assistance of his naive busboy George, has ulterior motives for operating this type of establishment. Beyond being able truly to think about the nature of what they are about to do, M. Boniface and Marcelle find that they may have problems embarking on their affair because of who they learn is also at the hotel: stormy weather-induced stuttering M. Martin, a barrister friend of the Bonifaces, and his four adolescent daughters; Victoire and Maxime, the Bonifaces' maid and M. Cot's nephew respectively, the two who want to partake in a little hanky-panky of their own; and M. Cot himself, this the hotel which is the one he is supposed to inspect. Beyond not wanting to be seen by those that know them, M. Boniface and Marcelle try to leave the hotel, which is easier said than done. Even if they are able to make it out of the hotel, M. Boniface and Marcelle may still have some issues when they make it home based on what may have been seen at the hotel. Through it all, a mysterious man with a professional problem observes the proceedings, the goings-on which may be able to assist in he overcoming his issue.",

But when Bobby is one of the thousands laid off by his company in the wake of an ongoing recession, Bobby must join the lines of the unemployed, but also deal with the effects it has on he and his family. Among the others laid off is Phil Woodward, an executive who rose from the factory floor to the corporate offices, but is now finding himself competing with men half his age as he reenters the job market. Meanwhile, Gene McClary is the number two executive at GTX and the vocal opposition to the layoffs, as he witnesses them happening to his friends and colleagues.",

    "synopsis": "Nearing his 60th birthday, a movie producer discovers that he may have less than a year to live as a result of inoperable cancer. The effects of his disease take the toll on him and his distressed wife. However, his dysfunctional family are not told and their soap opera-ish life goes on. His son, a has-been actor, has to deal with a precocious daughter and a drug-addled ex-wife and sells AIDS patients insurance policies until he becomes attracted to one. His step-sister learns that her real father murdered her mother & then committed suicide. A melodrama of a wealthy Los Angeles family - and the journey each one begins after a death in the family. The title of the film refers not only to the loss of life and love, but to a phrase used by most Angelenos while talking on cellular phones; I'm Losing You... \"I'm Losing You\" follows the path of each character after a cataclysmic event: the death of Bertie's young daughter Tiffany, in an \"accident\". The family comes closer together in the wake of such an event, seeking to recover from a blow that has driven each one to near madness.",

One of the allied republics is disregarding the order for disarmament. The atmosphere is tense, faces are solemn. It is at this round table that the decision for war or peace will be made. And yet: business as usual for the presidents present. But suddenly the speaker (the head of state on the floor) flies off the handle. He threatens to bring to justice one of the presidents there and then. All of a sudden masks are dropped at the conference table. Each one is at the same time aggressor and victim. \"Doom's Day\" is only a bat of an eyelid away. Nothing short of a miracle will save the world from unavoidable bloodshed.",

    "synopsis": "A year of educational life at a vibrant public K-12 school. Filmed on location over a year, the film celebrates the 75th anniversary of the University of Florida's premiere lab school P.K. Yonge Developmental Research School and documents the school's innovative approach to education. From seeing fifth graders use new technologies in science and second graders dance in music class, the film proves that public school can be truly work for teachers and students if faculty \"think out of the box\" and embrace new methods of education. Shaping the Future shows that the approach to teaching the \"whole child\" is the key to keeping kids in school and educating students for the 21st Century.",

Uri, in for 12 years for armed robbery, and Issan, in for 50 years for PLO violence, command the respect of their cells. When the Arabs are framed for the murder of a Jewish prisoner and a young inmate commits suicide rather than lie about what happened, Uri and Issan form an unlikely partnership, leading the security block on a strike. Prison officials try to break it. In the background are Uri's daughter and Issan's wife, women of beauty and passion who embody the distance from inside a cell to the outside.",

    "synopsis": "As dawn breaks and most of the city still sleeps, the long-time merchants of Vancouver's Chinatown are hard at work. They haul out their produce stands and set up their makeshift vendor carts in preparation for what they hope will be a busy day. But, like many ethnic enclaves in urban centres across North America, their clientele is dwindling. This once vibrant and thriving neighbourhood is in flux as new condo developments and non-Chinese businesses move in and gradually overtake the declining hub of the Chinese community. Everything Will Be, from Sundance award-winning director Julia Kwan, captures this fascinating transformation through the intimate perspectives of the neighbourhood's residents, diverse merchants and new entrepreneurs, who offer their poignant reflections on change, memory and legacy. A public art installation erected on the roof of a local real estate mogul's contemporary art gallery - housed in one of the oldest buildings in Chinatown - illuminates in neon the words 'EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT.' Night and day, this sign looms over Chinatown. Everything is going to be alright. The big question is - for whom? 2011. Vancouver's Chinatown has gone through a slow transformation over the years, where it is not nearly as vibrant in terms of sheer numbers of people on a day-to-day basis and the stability of life, especially in the businesses, as it was during its heyday. There are still some elements of the old Chinatown, such as some of the merchants (including one Italian grocer) and their way of doing business including the now ninety year old woman who sells Chinese language newspapers on a storefront stoop, the Chinese singing club, the mah jong halls, some of the old rooming houses, and the clan benevolent associations, which have all long acted as venues of socialization for the Chinese community and many housed in one hundred year old buildings. Some of the \"new\" generation of Chinese believe it is important to invest in their vision of what they see as their Chinatown, such as the woman who took over and updated her father's tea shop, and the artist who transformed a former storefront into his combined work/display/retail space. But with many of the traditional Chinese abandoning Chinatown, many of those older businesses have closed their doors, leaving empty storefronts, some which have been taken over by non-Chinese businesses. And Chinatown has not been immune to the development pressure that has hit Vancouver, with new high rise condo buildings springing up within and around the neighborhood. Arguably the most auspicious of Chinatown's new non-Chinese \"residents\" is development consultant 'Bob Rennie (II)' (qv), who has renovated some of those one hundred year old buildings, including one in which he houses his own art gallery, one of those art installations a 24/7 lit neon sign \"Everything Will Be Alright\" atop the building. With these aspects of old and new, there must be communication between the factions to create a vibrant neighborhood. A question then becomes for who this new Chinatown will serve and if those constituents still include the old Chinese as a collective. Will everything be alright?",

They fly along cliffs, dive without oxygen into the depths of the sea and prove the capabilities of the human body during the longest endurance bike race. What motives and thoughts have made them into modern day heroes? What causes the fascination for individuals who expose themselves to exceptional risks? The movie follows these people in the attempt to find the limits of performance. We get to know their environment, their companions, but also listen to critical voices. We hear the desires and fears of the families and venture, through the inner circle of friends, into the psyche of the athletes. And what motives are important for these pursuits? Is it the lust for fame? For immortality? For the absolute life experience?",

In this neorealistic comedy even if the situations are set up by the director, the two main characters are playing themselves, and solving the problems in their own way. In fact the camera follows the adventures of a real friendship in different countries, through different cultures.",

Through interviews and home movies, a portrait of a talented young man emerges - a musician, a recently married husband about to become a father, and a tough-minded investigative journalist. One of his kidnappers, Omar Sheikh, is also profiled: born in England, well-schooled, motivated perhaps by the desire to embarrass Pakistan's president, who was cooperating with the United States in the aftermath of 9/11. We visit the café in Karachi where Pearl was kidnapped. We see the site of his assassination. Loss colors all.",

The movie demonstrates what people faced in 1995 and still face today when they don't fit the mold prescribed by biblical \"clobber scriptures.\" The film challenges traditional \"my way or the highway\" views of salvation that straitjacket lives with narrow values and ideals.",

After many wrong turns brought on by the region's patchy cell reception, they finally reach the cabin and discover it's more isolated, frozen and forbidding than they thought. The husband, Chris, an optimistic unemployed actor who is determined to make the weekend a success and reconnect with his wife, implores her to put away her laptop and phone. His pleas fall on deaf - and irritated - ears, as Beth, a hard-working corporate professional and the sole provider for their household, is spearheading an urgent project with her corporate team the next week, which could make or break her career. When the Internet suddenly cuts out and interrupts Beth's work, the night takes a turn for the worse. Chris's suggestion that the cable might have been cut by somebody on purpose doesn't help, and Beth starts jumping at every shadow. Chris almost manages to convince her everything is fine, but then he looks out the window and sees for himself that someone is in fact prowling outside. Instantly they realize how isolated and vulnerable they truly are. In the face of their hostile assailant, Chris is forced to learn what it means to be a husband and, if not a provider, at least a protector. His ability to do so will determine whether they ever make it back to the city or not...",

    "synopsis": "This documentary essay follows the life of legendary blind gospel singer and founding member of the Grammy award winning, Blind Boys of Alabama, Clarence Fountain. We learn of Clarence's life, music and health through his dreamlike and hallucinatory memories while he receives kidney dialysis. These memories are woven together with past performances and current performances with a small band featuring long time collaborator and guitar player Sam Butler Jr. These performances are mostly intimate and take place in Clarence's living room, in recording studios and in small African-American Baptist churches in the deep south of the United States - Baton Rouge, Birmingham, Mississippi and New Orleans. The kidney dialysis dream sequences feature the kinetic abstract light paintings by the artist Bill Ham of 1960s San Francisco psychedelic light show era. These elements are combined with scenes from Lee Breuer and Bob Telson's celebrated theater piece, \" Gospel at Colonus\", featuring Morgan Freeman and Clarence Fountain and the Blind Boys of Alabama filmed by PBS in 1985. In this presentation the story of Oedipus as acted by Clarence and the Blind Boys parallel's his journey to find a \"happy death\".

Thousands of years ago many of these solders chose to fall to earth to live out their existence as mortals. But none of them could have expected what happened when they mixed their blood with ours. Every few generations, an offspring is born a little different. Half Angel or half Demon with immortality and untold powers, but only if they are willing to pay the price, their life. To live forever they have to die.",

    "synopsis": "The film develops through a commentary by Ajayan (Ashokan) about himself in the first person. Later he tells another story about his life with the same background. Finally both these stories fuse together. Ajayan was born an orphan. He is brought up by a doctor. A brilliant child, Ajayan grows up into an introvert and confused youth. The beautiful Suma (Shobhana) arrive at their house after marrying Balu (Mammootty), his foster-brother. Ajayan at the very first sight of his sister-in-law gets sexually attracted to her. This creates internal conflict within him and ultimately he leaves the house. In the second story Ajayan narrates his confused youth and about the beautiful girl, Nalini who enters his life. Ajayan's mind shifts often between reality and an imaginary romantic world. Finally both these stories converge to a point where both Nalini and Suma become a single entity.",

    "synopsis": "The creative eye goes deeper than the mechanics of eyesight. Blind painter Bijon Bose spent much of his life inspiring students by bringing stories to life through his paintings and idealism. His life is interrupted by a proposal to create a mural for an exclusive restaurant in the city of Kolkata, a journey that brings young strong-minded painter Tithi into his life. Their relationship unfolds through the lines of the mural, as they struggle between generations and life philosophies. Bijan's once clear lines of artistic integrity are troubled by Tithi's realism, as he grapples with his role and responsibility towards the life of his work beyond the brush.Bijon's blindness never stopped him from creating beauty. And now he is asked to see the world around him more clearly than ever before. For whom does a painter paint? For those who can pay? When a mural and the painter that created it start being a commodity? Chitrakar presents this tension between Art & Market.",

When it comes to education, business climate, redevelopment, and more, Clevelanders have come to expect the worse. Is a renaissance possible? Of course it is, but only if the city's leaders and residents are willing to learn from other cities such as Houston, Chicago, Oakland, and Indianapolis. And only if they're willing to try new approaches to old problems. Reason.tv's Nick Gillespie narrates and talks with educators, elected officials, businesspeople, policy experts, and residents from all walks of life in order to find ways to fix the \"mistake on the lake\" as well other once-great American cities.",

    "synopsis": "An Emmy-nominated public/current affairs program documenting and honoring the history of Lakeside. This film examines the six hundred acres of undeveloped land on the south side of Chicago that was once home to US Steel's mighty South Works steel plant and makes the case for why Lakeside is an ideal site for the Barack Obama Presidential Library. Although it was ultimately decided to build the Library on the campus of the University of Chicago, Lakeside remains an impressive parcel of land and was a serious contender. It was in the South Shore neighborhood around the former steel mill where a young Barack Obama first worked in Chicago as a community organizer and is where he launched his political career. Lakeside is being developed as a brand new residential, commercial, and industrial \"second downtown\" for the City of Chicago and is a multi-decades-long and ever-evolving endeavor.",

    "synopsis": "College sophomore Riley Adams dreams of being a world class elite dancer, believing her success can be a platform to share her Christian faith. Being raised in a single parent home, she's replaced the absence of her mother with the illusion of control, by learning to drive toward success by giving 150% all the time.. Victory in regional competition has gained her a coveted shot at the nationals, but a horrific accident brings her dreams to a halt and her illusion of control to a standstill. For the first time in her life, no amount of effort can affect change - at least not fast enough for Riley, who still believes she can recover in time for nationals. Equine therapy may help Riley gain full mobility, and true to character, Riley throws herself headlong into the process (spurred along a bit by an attractive and charming therapist). Through the process Riley develops a bond with a beautiful horse named Grace, and rediscovers her drive to succeed. Just when it seems the old Riley is back, and her confidence in her own effort is returning, disaster strikes and it seems everything Riley is working for is will come to naught. Through a moving spiritual odyssey, Riley finally comes to understand that it's not about effort and control, but surrender, and sees that her real purpose in life will be discovered by seeing circumstances through His eyes. The point is driven home when a completely unexpected act of kindness comes from a most unexpected place. Healed By Grace is a charming and heart wrenching journey of faith that explores the place of surrender that clears the veil and allows Riley to see through God's eyes and discover His purpose for her life.",

But when Drew's daughter, June, reads the book and sees the inscription, she jumps to the conclusion that her father is the man and Valerie the woman in her story of unrequited love. Further, she overhears her friend's mother say that Drew would get married if it weren't for his devotion to June. So June resolves to bring Valerie and her father together, not knowing that her father feels Valerie is too pushy, and that he's really fond of June's English teacher, Eleanor Emerson, and has even proposed marriage to her. When June learns of Drew's fondness for Eleanor, she even goes so far as to tell her she would not be welcome as a stepmother. Then June goes back to Valerie to tell her the way is cleared for her, but she sees another man in her house who admits he was the man in her novel. Thoroughly humiliated, June collapses in her bed in tears while Eleanor tells Drew she will not marry him. Drew comforts June, and when she feels better, she wonders how she can make amends to her father.",

    "synopsis": "The First Documentary About Hospice Care In China In the hospice care of Lvkang, Hangzhou, there are more than 60 patients, over 20 patients are gone in a year's time. Most of them can be hardly cured. Their family members sent them here to ease their pains and let them go with comfort and dignity. This documentary adopts the way of direct cinema approach. The old here lived a monotonous and boring life. Coming back home had become their greatest wish, which was put forward more than once, when their family came to visit them, but only to meet with a firm refusal. When holidays are approaching, their desire to go home was even more intense. And they would take the extreme step if the wish was unfulfilled. Medicine refusal, treatments rejection, hunger strike or even suicide, all those harmful measures were taken to arouse the attention of family members. Unfortunately, these actions were seen as pathological sickness by the hospital and also a selfish practice in family members' opinions. With the communication between the hospital and patients invalid, the gap between the two generations of the family is also getting more serious. Quarrel took place of communication. Accusing took place of understanding. Everyone's heart is full of unspeakable injustice. Ultimately, the very wish for going home not only failed, he instead was sent to a mental hospital by the collaboration of family and hospital. A dream remained covered.",

Now living only minutes away from his parents and sister in Florida, James allows viewers a glimpse behind the facade of, arguably, the best violinist in the world.",

The piece is anchored by the filmmaker's own mother, a journalist who focused on child labor and women's issues twenty years ago, and grandmother, and expands out to speak with farmers, maids, businesswomen, students, feminist writers and more.",

Tex enters the town posing as a tramp while the other two Rangers join a troupe of itinerant minstrels. Tex, convinced that while they may find the killer, it will not prevent further harassment of the poorer ranchers, and he returns to the Ranger station and persuades his father, Texas Ranger Captain John Wyatt, to take a leave of absence and go to Rawhide and run for Land Commissioner. Tex and his father meet Henry Colby, the wealthiest landholder in the district, who has been advised by his ranch foreman, Frank Hade, and Sam Barrett, the boss of Rawhide, that the nesters are the cause of all the lawlessness. At a meeting, preceded by the dullest, most demeaning minstrel show ever filmed, Captain Wyatt is shot (a fate that should have befallen the minstrels) and the bullet is found to be the same caliber as that used in the earlier killings, although Wyatt is only wounded. Mary Colby, riding the range, sees Barrett attempt to kill Tex using a rifle. Realizing he has been identified, Barrett hurries back to town where he meets the other gang members, and they prepare to fight against the Rangers.",

    "synopsis": "On the wind swept expanses of the South Dakota plains, life on the Pine Ridge Reservation is difficult. The land is harsh, unemployment is high, the consequences of endemic poverty are evident as the Lakota fight genocide on a daily basis. Using Lakota culture and traditions, the White Plume family created a plan for a sustainable economy by growing industrial hemp. Their tribe supported them and passed an ordinance acknowledging the difference between hemp and marijuana, which the DEA classifies as drugs. The White Plume family gathered and planted hemp on their family land. The federal government, refusing to acknowledge their sovereignty, raided their land. Determined to take a stand, the White Plumes planted again. In intimate details Standing Silent Nation documents their compelling story of environmental activism, traditional beliefs, and economic empowerment. Standing Silent Nation tells the story of a Lakota Indian family's struggle to assert their tribal sovereignty and maintain their values through the development of an industrial hemp-based economy.",

    "synopsis": "At work on his Elegies and Windows series, Motherwell examines his place in the Abstract Expressionist movement, which he calls the first original American movement in the \"mainstream,\" and its practitioners \"the last romantics.\" He distinguishes between his large paintings and his intimate papier collée. Motherwell recollects the state of American art in the 1940s and the impact of European emigré painters on the younger generation of emerging artists. He discusses the significance of collage, or papier collée, as an artist's medium and explains how he first became involved with this process. Motherwell offers his interpretations of earlier directions in art and his response to the object oriented painting that emerged in America in the 1960s. A unique document of one of the founding members of the New York School. He died in 1991.",

    "synopsis": "The story of Antarnaad is based on the work of Pandurang Shastri which over the last 36 years is revolutionizing the Indian countryside by transforming the lives of people in a way that can only be termed as miraculous. Today it affects the lives of over 5 million people and has changed the destinies of over 15 villages and towns. The story of the film is based on actual case studies of individuals and societies in two villages; One, a farming village and two a fishing village. The story of the film begins when three Swadhyayees go on a Bhaktipheri to two villages. The village infested by robbers takes too long to respond to these devotional hymes but another village, the fishery one, accepts them open heartedly and soon becomes a golden example of transformation itself. With the help of one of the swadhyayee's wife, they finally changes fate of second village as well.",

Each person that lives in or visits the haunted house is murdered or disappears. Rika is a young woman in Japan who takes care of an old woman named Sachie. While she is at the house, Rika finds a young boy named Toshio. She eventually finds about a curse, that anyone who enters the house will be killed by the spirit of Kayako. Rika must get herself out of the curse before it's too late. It looks like a normal, everyday house, but the atmosphere about it is anything but. Something happened here once... no, even now there is a terror here, born of a spirit that possesses this place. The various supernatural experiences undergone by the different owners of the house, unaware of the horrible events that have taken place here, mingle across time, and the true form of the terrifying, invisible \"Ju-On\" that nests in this house becomes clear... A very evil curse and vengeful spirits seem to linger upon a house where the horrific murder of a woman and child took place and anyone who sets foot inside the house is marked for a terrifying haunting which will not rest. One by one, those guys who have been tainted by the house begin to die, and nowhere is safe.",

Undaunted by the universal hatred of both their music and their look, the band perseveres, somehow netting themselves a hefty major label contract. But stardom proves elusive as they descend into a world of intrigue, nepotism, consumer research groups, excessive use of caffeine-laden soda pop and murder. Who kills the Ickys?

    "synopsis": "Tapa cloth or ngatu as it is called in Tonga, is cloth made from the bark of the mulberry tree. The inner bark is beaten into fine sheets and painted using traditional designs. After centuries of use, ngatu has literally become the fabric of Tongan society. In Tonga and throughout much of Polynesia, bark cloth has deep symbolic and ceremonial use. At birth, babies are swaddled in it. At marriage, newlyweds line their wedding bed, and at death, the departed are buried wrapped in it. This documentary investigates the highly collaborative process of making ngatu and the organizations of women who carry on with the tradition. While the process continues to be passed on from generation to generation, there are signs of change as a cash economy begins to infiltrate Tongan life. Young people show less interest in such labor intensive endeavor in the face of the older generation's belief that this tradition will never die.",

The Earth's cities, forests, icecaps are beginning to foul with toxic sludge! The villainous powerful dictator orbot, known as Warhead is born, and he stands for tyranny, hatred and oppression. He declares himself ruler of Earth, and prepares to execute any humans who dare return to their planet! But only one orbot, by the name of Vectorman, who is cleaning up toxic sludge by simply discharging it into the sun. He finds chaos and confusion! Because all the other Orbots are controlled by Warhead, and Vectorman will take it upon himself to destroy the errant orbot and restore peace to Earth once again. The future of the human race looks hopeless when maintenance drones accidentally replace the orbot leader's head with a salvaged atomic bomb. All the orbots on Earth are immediately ordered, via television receivers, to stop cleaning up the planet and to start manufacturing weapons for an impending ambush of the returning humans. Only one orbot, a sludge barge pilot who was out of communications range, is unaffected by the evil take-over. You are that pilot: and his name is Vectorman. The only hope of the entire human race is for you to destroy the villainous WarHead. You must seek him out by following a trail of television receivers around the Earth, and then confront him in a battle that will decide the fate of the human race and of the planet Earth itself.",

Through interviews with victims of this disease, Fuji TV sheds a light on \"fibrinogen,\" a blood-clotting agent that had been kept away in the dark. Both the Japanese government and pharmaceutical companies say that the Fibrinogen used in the 1980's no longer exists. But we discovered it in a hospital located in the country, and tested its genetic level. The tests revealed for the first time that the drug in fact was contaminated with the hepatitis C virus. When this program was aired, those infected with Hepatitis C by the blood-clotting agent filed a class action suit against both the government and pharmaceutical companies.",

Since the location of the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant was finally determined on 4 February 1985, many people have changed their accustomed patterns of life. In its continuing line of development and its thematic diversity this film provides a profound insight into the process of landscape and ecologic destruction; and it describes the intentions behind the construction of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in terms of atomic policies. Once loyal citizens have been turned into hesitant radicals. Women civil servants, housewifes and mothers all reveal their awareness of a political and social responsibility that extends far beyond any initial expression of indignation.",

    "synopsis": "Kristian (Mugge), Casper (Sřgaard), and Jakob (Nasser) are friends and neighbours and share a friendship based on humour and irony, and as all other young men, they all take a great interest in film, sports, girls, sex and partying. They also share, however, some seriously challenging living terms; all three of them suffer from Progressive Muscular Dystrophy, and thus - with a pinch of characteristic black humour - refer to themselves as the \"Skin and Bones\" guys. They live their lives strapped to wheelchairs, on which various devices and equipment are attached which enable them some mobility and constantly blow essential air into their fragile bodies. They are surrounded 24-7 by professional helping and caring hands to help them pee, shit, eat, and dress; but it's impossible for them to enjoy any form of private life, so for obvious reasons it's difficult, bordering on impossible for them to find love - and sex. Nevertheless they all three share an amazingly great zest for life. Being bent on living to the full - however short their lives may be - they also exhibit much more serenity on the issue of death than so many others. The Danish film director Michael Staal Dinesen has followed the three guys during four years, and his film is an honest and boundless account of the challenges that the three men are facing. But also a wonderful and heart-warming celebration of life against all odds.",

    "synopsis": "Campus Police is a mockumentary film chronicling a week in the line of duty for two campus police officers at a college called Driftwood University. Officers Colin McCoy and Dan Foley expect this week to be business as usual, but are caught off-guard when they're suddenly thrust into a storm of conspiracy and corruption, all surrounding a series of attacks by a mysterious flasher. Over the course of the week, they face apathetic theatre students, singing buffoons, office politics, a psychic palm-reader, and a drug-crazed lunatic who launch them into the most high-profile case of their careers. Campus Police is a film in the spirit of the zany, screwball comedies of yesteryear.",

The young teacher's first week with her new students is enjoyable, but she gradually notices that many of the students are skipping school. Visiting her students' after class she realizes that many of them are charged with work and tasks like making money, toiling on the farm, doing housework or tending to their younger siblings. Moreover, many of them live in unhygienic homes due to poverty or overwork. She not only reports and explains the situation to the school's principal, but also attempts to improve the conditions by making textbooks, teaching cleanliness and making her classes relevant. With students still unhealthy she takes things one step further and takes the students to the ocean to procure oysters, to the mountain to dig up potatoes and generally help with their nutrition. One student, however, falls from the hill and is injured leading to an angry and complaining parent. The teacher is about to quit, but others are sure she means well and has helped more than anything or anyone.",

With a camera in hand, the socially-awkward filmmaker stepped blindly into many venues and approached other socially-awkward strangers with sincere curiosity. Unsatisfied to create the usual film that encourages audiences to marvel at the \"freaks\", the filmmaker used her own experiences of exploration and discovery to shape the film, which is an honest, affectionate look at gamers in gamers' own words. The bottom line is that chances are, someone you work with is a closet gamer.",

    "synopsis": "The Reverend Justin Somerton (Michael Bryant), a professor of Medieval History, is approached by a former pupil - Lord Peter Dattering (Paul Lavers). Dattering fears that his widowed mother is being exploited by a couple of charlatans posing as mediums and offering her the chance to commune with her late husband. Somerton agrees to attend one of their séances and outwits the fraudsters. Somerton tells Dattering of the research he has been conducting into the history of a monastery and shows him a book which details the exploits of a former Abbot - and of the treasure he is reputed to have hidden somewhere within the catacombs of the monastery. The two find a number of clues to the location of this treasure, not just in the Latin texts but in a stained glass window. They ignore the warning that the treasure is protected by a guardian - shaking Somerton's rational beliefs to the core.",

    "synopsis": "Germany is one of the most democratic societies in the world, and has the fastest growing Jewish community in Europe. This never could have been imagined in 1945. Through personal stories, the film explores the country's transformation from silence about the Holocaust to facing it head on. Informative documentary that looks at two things: the process by which the German public has gradually become capable of addressing what happened during WW2 and in the Holocaust in particular; and the process by which Jews have gradually felt that it is possible to feel at home in Germany despite the traumatic legacy of the Holocaust.",

Just what is it that drives David to spend so much time in such a wild and hazardous environment? Alone Among Grizzlies follows them to one of nature's most epic events, the Alaskan salmon run, where they get within touching distance of some of the biggest bears on earth and David demonstrates how he gains the trust of these dangerous predators. They also seek out, and then camp in, the infamous place where bear fanatic Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend were tragically mauled to death by wild bears in 2003. Packed with adventure, stunning wildlife footage and moments of genuine jeopardy, Richard will follow some truly grizzly encounters as the two adventurers attempt to survive off the land alongside the mighty coastal brown bears of Kodiak Island.",

    "synopsis": "It's winter in a small southern Norwegian town in the late nineteenth century. After years of struggling, Dr. Thomas Stockmann and his family - his wife Catherine, their young adult daughter Petra, and their two adolescent sons Ejlif and Morten - have returned to town after being away for five years up north, he now well respected and successful as the medical resident of the Health Institute at Kirsten Springs, where he is also a board member. He devised the springs and institute as a center of therapeutic benefits on his own, but developed it with his brother, the town mayor, Peter Stockmann, who is the board chair. They have reinvigorated what was the financially crumbling town. Peter takes credit for giving Thomas this air of respectability, something that has never been important to Thomas, who would rather be seen as a man of conviction in doing the right thing. In this respect, Petra takes after her father. Thomas often writes articles for the local activist newspaper, The People's Daily Messenger, as part of doing the right thing. The Messenger's editor, Hovstad, who is attracted to Petra, sees the mayor as part of a group of townsfolk in positions of power solely for their own benefit - an old boys' club. Thomas' latest article, not yet published and what he wanted to investigate during the springs' off season before tourists start arriving in the spring, concerns the water supply at Kirsten Springs. As he feared, in the board's decision to locate the institute's water supply in the cheapest site and in the process dismissing Thomas' original recommendations, the water is being polluted, contaminated by being located downstream from a tannery. Through the story, Thomas wants to protect the overall public health, and does not want to be seen as a hero or extraordinary in doing so. When Peter finds out about the article, he does whatever he can to quash the story, including fear mongering, intimidation and using the power of being both the mayor and the board chair. His primary concern is increasing the viability of the institute by increasing the number of visitors, while doing as little as possible to increase costs, fixing the water problem, which he is not convinced even exists, being cost prohibitive. Although not his direct motivation, Peter is not averse to ruining Thomas' reputation in the process, making Thomas an enemy of the public which would make it easier to protect his own interests even more. Based on a play by Henrik Ibsen. A small forest town is trying to promote itself as a place for tourists to come enjoy the theraputic hot springs and unspoiled nature. Dr. Stockmann, however, makes the inconvenient discovery that the nature around the village is not so unspoiled. In fact, the runoff from the local tanning mill has contaminated the water to a dangerous degree. The town fathers argue that cleaning up the mess would be far too expensive and the publicity would destroy the town's reputation, so therefore news of the pollution should be suppressed. Dr. Stockmann decides to fight to get the word out to the people, but receives as very mixed reaction. A small-town doctor discovers that, for economical reasons, his colleagues propose to conceal that the local health spa is contaminated by tannery water.",

    "synopsis": "The only things Gray Golden loves more than land and money are his flawed adult children and the game of tennis. When tragedy strikes the California real estate magnate just as he is about to break ground on the massive development project he believes will be his greatest legacy to his family and to the world; his daughter, Silly, a former child-star forever in search of being taken seriously, steps forward to see that her father's interests are protected. Meanwhile, her brother, Stew, an intellectually challenged tennis pro Gray has kept hidden away at a private club in Malibu, finally emerges from his father's shadow by attempting to bring the new wood racquet he's been building to market. Surrounded by a cast of supporting characters that could only be found in L.A., BRING THE WOOD blasts forward at bullet speed as bodies pile up on all sides and souls are saved in the grand tradition that buried beneath every great fortune, if not family, lies a great crime.",

The money leads us to each of the five offbeat characters, all in desperate need of their soul's redemption: a disillusioned tabloid reporter planning to commit suicide in a motel, a nightclub dancer con prostitute who has avowed to give her kid sister a better life, a fallen henchman resurfacing to score big time, a chronic runaway teenage girl held captive as sex slave by a cop, and a long-suffering son bearing a sadomasochistic relationship with his brutish, half-paralyzed father who behaves like a mad dictator in his wheelchair. Like a ticking time bomb, the story unravels with unforgiving immediacy and explodes in the end with a tabloid front-pager triple homicide where death seems to have come full circle.",

We see that glorious victory, we meet people young and old for whom each year's Palio is life's most important event, we see the drawing that assigns a horse to each contrada, and we observe the feasting and pageantry beforehand. Then, the running of the race: will Civetta experience the elation of victory or the bitterness of loss?",

    "synopsis": "A solitary loggerhead turtle in the middle of a vast ocean may not sound like an adventure film, but stick with her. Along her 9,000-mile voyage to nest, our loggerhead tour guide in Voyage of the Lonely Turtle encounters hammerhead sharks, deep ocean tempests, and man-made death traps in the form of fishing nets and hooks. Her body of well-suited armor and specialized adaptations for deep-ocean dwelling will help the sea turtle evade many of the ocean's menaces. But this is just one set of challenges to overcome. Here is another: she must find her way across the Pacific, from Mexico to a small stretch of beach in Japan, a precise location that she has been to just once before, as a two-inch hatchling, decades ago. Researchers have learned a great deal about how this curious creature could make such a phenomenal voyage. Some of the most valuable information was gained from a single voyage. Scientist Wallace J. Nichols released the captive loggerhead turtle, Adelita, into the Pacific a decade ago. Over the course of a year, Adelita did what no sea turtle had ever done before, she took researchers and turtle enthusiasts along on her journey, to her beach, to nest. Since then, researchers have shed much light on how sea turtles like loggerheads navigate the astounding trip. One of the more fascinating aspects of this navigation is the turtle's use of magnetic mapping to chart its course.",

    "synopsis": "Imagine a prison with some ten thousand prisoners, many of them dangerous and, to control them, only a few unarmed employees. Small in number, these employees work in shifts. They are almost prisoners themselves, in a routine of tension, but also of humor and emotion. This prison was all too real. While it was in existence, the Carandiru was the largest prison in Latin America, administered by a reduced number of employees. The documentary shows, from the point of view of these few employees, holding the keys, how the prison operated: the delicate balance in the relationship with the prisoners, affinity among employees, moments of tension and, even, of happiness. These are stories told by former employees, among them, Dr Dráuzio Varela, author of the book Estaçăo Carandiru. These are the secrets of a place that is no more.",

The favorite entertainment of the Russian Colonel in charge of the prison was to have the inmates play Russian Roulette. Only his unbelievable luck and survivor spirit helped Moldovan live through his detention. Out of the prison the ex-policeman joins an international Russian Roulette illegal gaming circuit. In late 70's faith brings him to a Central Eurpean town where Goldberg (Vladimir Gaitan / Cristian Motiu), an old acquaintance of his is organizing an \"improved\" version of the game where two opponents are shooting each other. Step by step Moldovan meets lots of familiar faces, both friends and enemies. It looks like the whole Bucharest's underworld from the 40's chose to meet here.",

    "synopsis": "The film is a drama about three, four memories in one night that three, four (the fourth is physically absent, but no less present at the same time) spend together, with no obligations, free of all bonds, as the night before they finished all relationships. The story in the film is happening from the morning, where/when the film starts until the night of the previous day, where/when the film ends. Everything that happens in the film is about what happened before that, before the beginning (end) of the film, when we, the spectators, entered the story, just like we were a substitution for the Fourth after his disappearance. The film is a story about remembering, three views in the same night that are trying to review its variety. The film turns the memories into dreams and reflects the surrealism of our own memories and realities.",

    "synopsis": "Kerala famously known as Gods own country is, endowed with natural beauty with its lush green landscapes and rivers crisscrossing the length and breadth of the state. At the northernmost part of Kerala, is the Kasargod district, once bestowed with greenery, is now a haunted place. The use of endosulfan, a highly dangerous pesticide, had catapulted the entire area, a land of diseases and trauma. Widespread use of Endosulfan at cashew plantations, had not only killed pests, but affected the ecological balance of the area and severely affected humans and animals alike and resulted in diseases ranging from physical deformity to genetic problems, thus making the entire district a symbol of morbidity. Following widespread agitation against the usage of endosulfan, its use has been stopped by the government, but neverthless decades of widespread usage had killed thousands and made many more living victims. Having seen and experienced this atrocious use of chemicals and its side effects at Kasargod which is nearby my native, I though of a film on this issue, through which I could bring into limelight and make people aware, the tragedy of unethical use of chemicals and other pesticides.",

One of the Kitten Club showgirls, Flo tells Chris that when Diane came to the club for an audition, she incurred the wrath of the heavy-drinking featured singer Marianne Mason and club owner Steve Raymond delegated her to the hostess ranks of girls whose job was to steer customers to the illegal gambling. This led to a couple of suckers, Wilbur Harris and Ed Blake, losing heavily in the crooked game with Harris committing suicide and Blake being killed in the the ensuing męlée.",

    "synopsis": "Arranged by a smuggling syndicate, A-Hong and his young teen sister along with a group of Burmese youngsters sneak across the Myanmar/Thailand border and arrive in a remote town called Dagudi in Northern Thailand. A-Hong's sister is taken away by the gangs as her mother has sold her to them. A-Hong goes to Bangkok and works under a tour guide, a wildcatter from Myanmar who has lived in Thailand illegally for years. The flood has killed the tourism business. A-Hong followed this big brother back to Dagudi, trying to sell a batch of medicine that could be made into profitable drugs to local gang leaders. All A-Hong wants is to get the cash quickly and redeem his sister, but he cannot reach the smuggling ring anymore as the phone number never works. San Mei, a young Burmese woman who is assigned a job by the smuggling syndicate to fetch A-Hong's sister, has been taking her risk by smuggling Burmese teenage girls overseas, hoping to get the Taiwanese Identity Card promised by the gang leader for years. After accomplishing the last assignment, she realizes the dream to gain the sense of security is hopeless. Unfolded through two parallel narratives, this is a border town story woven between Tolstoy, amphetamines and Durian.",

But now 30, and tired of competing with 18-year-olds, Dolce realizes what makes her feel most alive is also killing her. Before starting a new career behind the camera, she embarks on a long road trip home, shooting with her favorite photographers one last time, and shedding her lifestyle-acquired vices along the way. Combing real photoshoots shot cinéma vérité-style with a narrative based on some very real-life adventures in front of the lens, BROKEN SIDE OF TIME is a dark, sexual glimpse into a world never before captured in a film. A world where any woman can play the role of a model, and any man can be a photographer, and where even the best of them must consider whether the fame and money is worth the cost.",

A class of \"mulattos\" begins to emerge, with a trade-based financial power that threatens the landlords. A new identity arises, a mix of old and new, of African and Portuguese culture, sensual and dynamic. The songs of Cesária Évora follow this inevitable transformation. From the novel by Henrique Teixeira de Sousa.",

    "synopsis": "Becoming a dog musher was Harry Okpik's childhood dream. But during the Dog Slaughter in the early 1960s, when government agents shot thousands of Inuit huskies across the Canadian Arctic, 11-year-old Harry saw the sky turn red and thought his dream forever destroyed. Twelve years later, after traumatic residential schooling, another personal tragedy struck when he suffered a shooting accident. Three years of intense hospitalization and estrangement from his community followed. Then Harry made the harrowing decision to amputate his leg - one he believed would forever rob him of his hopes of becoming a real man, a father, a true Inuk; a decision that would lead him to recovery and back to his home, the north. Filmed over the course of several seasons, we follow Harry as he recounts the momentous events of his life and cares for his magnificent husky dogs in preparation for the Ivakkak - a gruelling 600 km Inuit dog sled race across the Canadian Arctic.",

The Sandman is a small man with a white beard that comes at night and spreads sand onto the eyes of the sleeping children. This is the beginning sequence while there is singing and the typical music. This is followed by a cartoon which is different from episode to episode, often featuring children or animals. After 10 minutes it ends with an end sequence similar to the one at the beginning, but this time they sing: \"Kinder, liebe Kinder, es hat mir Spaß gemacht, nun schnell ins Bett und schlaft recht schön, dann will auch ich zur Ruhe gehn. Ich wünsch euch Gute Nacht.\"",

    "synopsis": "On the night of his brother's wedding, best man Charlie (Graham Coffeng) gets the old gang back together for a fun-filled, post reception after party, at the newlyweds' home, where he has been staying for several weeks. Unsure of how to proceed with his own troubled marriage, Charlie reunites \"the fellas\" fifteen years after high school, in hopes that revisiting the past will help him find clarity for the future. What he finds, however, is that while his friends have all taken different paths, they are all faced with similar conundrums that comes with being in one's thirties. Thirty-somethings Matt and Claire have just gotten married in Vancouver. While Matt and Claire go off on their wedding night, Charlie, the best man and Matt's gay brother, invites many of his and Matt's friends, plus a couple of the staff from the reception, back to Matt and Claire's suburban house for an afterparty, the house where Charlie has been staying for the past several weeks. This group of friends knew each other from but many have not seen each other since high school, many of them who came from out of town to attend the wedding. Charlie came to the city, against the wishes of his husband Derek, to try and make it big in acting, which has always been a passion. At the beginning of the party, Charlie receives an ultimatum telephone call from Derek to come home. As Charlie, over the course of the party, contemplates what to do about his marriage, he, not telling his friends about the telephone call, hopes to catch a glimpse of what happiness and success is from among this group who are at the same stage of life as him. Only an outsider may be able to see that Charlie will have a difficult time finding what he hopes to see in his friends.",

His partner follows him inside the mine but is blown-up by a dynamite charge set-up by Sam on purpose. Now alone, Sam takes a load of dust gold and heads toward the nearest town. On the way, Sam meets a group of starving desperadoes who steal his horses and his food, ignoring the gold dust in the canvas sacks. Sam dumps the gold dust in the river and goes on foot, passing the Sierras, the desert and the abandoned Spanish Catholic Mission before arriving in town. Once in town, Sam sends a wire to his adoptive son, Manolo Sanchez, whom he trusts, to come meet him. Manolo arrives in town and meets with Sam who asks for Manolo's help in working his secret gold mine. Unfortunatelly, Manolo also runs into an old friend, a ruthless killer named Brent, who wants his share of the gold. Sam is angry but has no choice but to take both Manolo and Brent along. However, for protection, Sam asks an old army buddy of his, Mason, to join the group. Mason is sour at Sam for their desertion from the army and for Mason's subsequent capture and imprisonment in an army brig for 3 years. But the lust of gold is strong and Mason joins the group for half of the profits. The four men buy mining tools, supplies and food from a local store, raising the storekeeper's suspicions about a possible gold strike. In the morning they depart, heading for Sam Cooper's secret gold mine and straight into trouble.",

    "synopsis": "Rules of the Road tells the story of a love affair and its demise through one of the primary objects shared by the couple: an old beige station wagon with fake wood paneling along the sides. A typical American family car for an atypical American family, it provides the women at first with all the familiar comforts. But when their relationship ends, the car becomes the property of one woman and the bane of the other's existence. Even long after their separation, this tangible reminder of their life together--and thousands of its imitators--continues to prowl the streets of the city, haunting the woman who no longer holds the keys either to the car or the other woman's heart. Rules of the Road is also study in theme and variations. In this case, the theme is the standard wagon. The variations are a consequence of experience, which transforms the object and makes us continually invest it with new meanings. This sense of constant change happens during the course of the film just as surely as it happens to us in our daily lives. Through spoken text, popular music and images from the streets of New York, Rules of the Road takes a somewhat whimsical, somewhat caustic look at how our dreams of freedom, pleasure, security, and family are so often symbolized by the automobile.",

In the fall of 1980, the small town of Independence, Kentucky was rocked by a massive gas explosion at its high school, causing millions of dollars worth of damage, dozens of injuries, and the untimely death of one of its brightest students, 16-year-old Robert Williams. But in face of adversity, a team of young men fought back. With no school to attend or gym to practice in, the Boy's Varsity Basketball team carried on with their season in an attempt to inspire their fellow students and unite the entire community. In rallying around their team, the town of Independence found a way to heal and rebuild. With unbelievable strength, they picked up the pieces of their lives and moved on the way they knew best - by playing basketball.",

The family then robs a bank and kills two tellers before dropping in on Charley Gately, leader of the group that hanged old man Hagen, and kills him and his son Gabe and daughter-in-law Ruth. And they head for the border and it gets really mean and nasty.",

Sometimes the fact gets tangled up with the fiction as Rupert uncovers about a time now gone, of loss and of how carefully we consider exactly what it is that we love about the cities we live in.",

Zura is forced to watch as his father is slaughtered by members of his small village. The mother escapes with the boy, eventually moving away and living in a run-down apartment in Tbilisi where a new life (hopefully) awaits. However, a new location canot begin to erase the psychological trauma the boy has experienced and this manages to affect his every relationship; neighbours, his new teacher, schoolmates & even his mother. His father's death at the banks of the lake (hence the title), have twisted his strong personality towards sinister/evil ways. His pent-up grief manifests itself in dark ways... can he possibly ever escape his anger and sorrow? Inspired by Heinrich Mann's \"Abdication\" (short-story).",

Manong Gerry was way ahead of its time when he tackled such controversial themes and its takes guts on his part to do that. Also can't imagine seeing Johnny Monterio portraying the role of a gay. Monterio, known for his breathtaking fencing skills, appeared in countless action and adventure movies pitting him mostly with another popular action star, Efren Reyes.",

From Selma and Birmingham, and Atlanta, to the battleground beaches of St. Augustine, Florida, with Chinua Achebe, and back north for a visit to Newark with Amiri Baraka, Baldwin lays bare the fiction of progress in post-Civil Rights America-wondering \"what happened to the children\" and those \"who did not die, but whose lives were smashed on Freedom Road.\"",

Billy Carson heads a team of anomaly hunters who tirelessly pore over every feature in these photos in the pursuit to uncover out of place artifacts strewn about the solar system. What they have found on Venus, Mars and from the ISS not only suggests the active presence of extraterrestrials, but the expansion of a human-based secret space program and breakaway civilizations. As we continue to push the limits of disclosure, a number of credible sources are now willing to come forward to confirm what has been discovered in the data released by NASA.",

A relentless secret service agent tries to rescue the president before midnight when the truck will detonate.",

Gerard Sports Marketing (GSM) has teamed up with Chinese partner, Wabsono International - and the Chinese government - to bring the sport of surfing to the Chinese people. Everyday - twice a day - in the City of Hangzhou (pronounced \"han-joe\"), a tidal bore wave rolls upstream on the Qiantang (pronounced \"kwin-tang\") River. And each year, in September, the wave is at its largest. To witness this awesome sight, hundreds of thousands of Chinese people come to the annual Wave Watching Festival in Hangzhou. And this year, they're here to see surfing for the very first time. For this trip, we brought the Long brothers, and Mark Healey. The purpose of this trip was to demonstrate to the Chinese government that surfing on the river was feasible... and that the idea of broadening the annual festival to include surfing is a good one.",

    "synopsis": "This autobiographical film is based on the travel diaries of a painter during his stay in New York City in 2012. His voice-over speaks of an atypical Manhattan; a puzzle of interlocking neighborhoods and people that belies the mirage of a city. Uncovering its hypnosis, its disenchantment, the hidden face of its luminescence, this un-love story reveals the dark side of the city.",

He has heart problems, seeks a transplant, and then goes in search of a son sired years before in Tahiti.

He leaves his bed one night - and his lover - to kill an intruder; he dreams, usually of violence. Will his body accept his heart? Will his son accept his offer?",

    "synopsis": "\"I want to act.\" These words ring out thousands of times a day in classrooms, cafés, and bathroom mirrors around the world. Everyone wants to act, but how many people actually know what goes on behind all the smoke and mirrors? How many people really understand what an exquisite, painful, joyful, and terrifying experience the actor's journey is? From Broadway divas to stars of the silver screen, from drug addicts to TV regulars, from strippers to top runway models, The Deena Levy Theatre Studio has been teaching actors at all levels and from all walks of life to 'unlock the secrets' for 15 years. Known as so much more than just an acting teacher, Canadian Deena Levy uses a unique combination of techniques, including Grotowski, Method, and Meisner, to help her students at her studio in Manhattan find their own voices and live authentically both on stage and off. This documentary follows the students' progress throughout the school year, culminating in their powerful and self-reflexive performances in the showcase they write themselves, entitled \"You, Actor.\" Through interviews, classes, and performances, the film explores Deena Levy's innovative processes and positive, transformational approach, which is so vital in these challenging times.",

    "synopsis": "Contrary to popular myth, butch lesbians are not trying to be feminine and failing. They are not going through a rebellious stage or imitating men. They are women who, while being true to their most authentic selves, look and behave in some ways that society has decided is appropriate only for males. While lesbians and gay men are enjoying more acceptance from society in general, this tolerance is often limited to those individuals who seem most like their heterosexual counterparts: feminine women and masculine men. The women in this film examine and challenge society's assumptions about gender roles and show the courage it takes to be true to oneself. Their struggles reveal how everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, is pressured to conform and measure up to restrictive gender standards.",

    "synopsis": "Discover fresh insights into several Greek myths that teach us about the relationship between gods and humans. Is Prometheus a troublemaker (according to Hesiod) or a liberator (according to Aeschylus)? What happened after Pandora's box of evil spirits was opened? How did Persephone's kidnapping inspire the Eleusinian Mysteries? Begin your journey into the mythology of Asia and the Pacific with the story of Fu Xi, which illustrates a profound truth about both Chinese society and the mythology of the Pacific Rim: culture and human relations come first. See how the importance of social networks, the omnipresence of water, and the value of sacrifice comprise the three key motifs of the myths of this region. Journey through the Great Plains to look at new myths involving creatures and environments that can't be duplicated in other regions. Hear the fascinating story of the Buffalo Woman, and learn the way myths not only connect different groups of people, but also serve as a beacon of individuality. Jump into the distinctive elements of African mythology with the story of Shango--a fearsome king of the city-kingdom of Oyo who later became a god. Explore how the cyclical structure of the story is another distinctive feature of African myths. Rather than moving in a straight line, African myths may start in the middle, seem to end, circle back to the beginning, and then reach a conclusion. Investigate the mythological roots and legacies of the powerful--but flawed--Greek hero, Herakles. Explore common threads that run through some of his twelve labors, including the slaying of the Hydra and the cleaning of the Augean stables. Also, ponder Herakles's role in ancient Greek society as both mortal and god. Hear a riveting Inuit story of Sedna, the Old Woman (or Earth Mother) who lives under the sea. You'll also encounter the Nanabushu stories and the archetype of the Trickster, who is often a cultural hero, responsible for aiding in the creation of what we know today. Welcome to the ancient Greek myths: some of the most popular, well-known stories in Western civilization. When did these tales emerge, and what are our earliest sources for them? Find out in this lecture on father-son conflicts between Uranus, Kronos, Zeus, and the other first-generation gods known as the Titans.",

    "synopsis": "New York is one of the most dynamic and fastest paced cities in the world, with a complex structure representing all layers of society. At the summit are the \"Kings and Queens\" - The Vanderbilts, Rockefellers and Kennedys; the paragons of Western Civilization. But at the lowest level of this urban landscape lies a dark and frightening place, pulled from the pages of a macabre science fiction novel. A place which is inhabited by the \"Mole People\". Voices in the Tunnels takes you on an investigative search of this urban myth - The existence of a fragmented outcast people living on the fringes of society in New York' underbelly. People who live in dark morbid dwellings where most of us would dread visiting, let alone living. Without a map or blueprint, the film crew investigates this story, following leads based on fact and fiction, myth and reality. In our search, we traverse vast, dark, windless tunnels - Sometimes finding nothing but a pale reflection of our souls in a place without solace. Only when they were ready, did those living below the busy streets of New York reveal themselves to us. Some of these inhabitants found the pressures of daily life too demanding and hard to bear to the point that skulking with rats below seemed easier than the \"rat race\" above. Others simply found peace and comfort in their solitude and engulfing darkness. As with any other society, this one too has a code of conduct and dictates of ethics that places theft from other underground dwellers as a more serious crime than murder - After all, when you have so little, what you do have is priceless. Six years after the first real evidence of these underground dwellers was revealed in Jennifer Toths' book \"The Mole People\", our film continues where she left off ...",

Their attempts to covertly dispose of the body and move on with their lives are challenged by their nosy landlady (and self-styled detective) Amy Ann, and her uncle, NYPD Officer Lyman. At the party they throw to divert suspicion from themselves, Bob and Luca are less concerned with John's murder than in their romantic competition over Kay, a friendly Kmart cashier. Their evening is complicated by the arrival of John's enigmatic sister Marisa, a series of threats from Grendel (a member of John's secret gang), and the reappearance of the dead body. Bob and Luca are cleared of suspicion when the body falls (or, perhaps, is thrown) out of an upper-story window and his death is ruled a suicide. Amy Ann, refusing to believe that her lover would commit suicide, insists on solving the murder and uncovering the truth.",

Songs included on this DVD include 'Time After Time', 'Moon River', 'Waters of March', 'It Ain't Necessarily So' and the show-stopping 'Listen to My Heart'.

Unable to meet the demands of the workaday world, Hick wanders alone through the city and, as in many of Achternbusch's films, enters an intermediate realm in which the dead interact with the living: he encounters and falls in love with a mummy, searches for an Egyptian queen, and stalks the inner regions of the hereafter, which lie in the middle of Munich.",

Faux expert testimony from more than a dozen \"professors\" and those who supposedly contributed to that era, is the hilarious glue that fuses it all together and connects the past with the present. Grind house refers to the operations of a 24 hour theater that grinds out films around the clock. The term grind comes from the cranking sound that the old projectors made. Others say it refers to the early grind house films that showed girls stripping and grinding in back street 1930's burlesque theaters. The grindhouse films were hyped as the scourge to decency, attracting sexually oppressed and frustrated urbanites to seedy theaters that featured these movies all night long. These films thumbed their nose at the morality of Puritan ethics that millions abides by but secretly hated.",

She's too old, she's too fat, she's too broke , she has too many responsibilities and way too many dogs. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!! but... she thinks that she's still \"got it\" and nothing is going to stop her! She is fearless, demanding, obsessed, dramatic, smart, sexy, impulsive, courageous, loving, furious and very funny! She's not going to sit back and wait for \"them\" (the business) to give it to her...she's going to make it happen even if it's going to kill her...which it almost does. On her journey she hooks up with kindred spirits who inspire her, sabotage her, threaten her, and excite her, challenge her, make her go nuts and ultimately help her to see that finding out who you are in life is what it's all about.",

She's no match for Bebel's tricks, despite cruel abuse, but the gang also annoys the public, including the dumb police commissioner. After a mix-up between their bomb-alert prop and a real terrorist group's African embassy attack, Bebel's bunch is condemned to pass their exams or go to jail, and the commissioner, charged with supervision, is in no mood to let them off easily.",

Archival footage accompanies their recollections of being part of the U.S. forces that helped liberate Italy from Fascism and Nazi occupation.",

    "synopsis": "Adrian Mendoza (52) has become a widow due to the effects of the war and together with his children, Juan de Dios (12) and Maria del Carmen (10), confronts the fatal situation that prevails in the convulsed city of Ayacucho. Adrian is returning to his home with Juan de Dios with only a few minutes to spare before the 6 p.m. curfew takes effect when suddenly the music on the car radio is interrupted by subversive messages. In this situation a police patrol stops Adrian for a routine search. Adrian attempts in vain to change the station on the radio and the police take him into custody as a presumed terrorist on the basis of the messages coming from the radio. His position as a university professor complicates things. On one hand he is branded as a terrorist and a fugitive from the law; on the other hand, the terrorists coerce him to unite with them. In the days that follow more than a dozen soldiers raid his home and he is taken to the dreaded Pink House where he will be cruelly tortured.",

Among the professionals profiled on the series were female astronauts, wild-animal trainers, \"ladies who luge,\" bungie-jumpers, street performers, and even dominatrixes. In other words, it was Murphy Brown for real.",

    "synopsis": "Jeff Stokes is an artist whose need to create extends beyond the canvas; in fact, his need/obsession is to procreate. This obsession paves the way for Jeff to strike a damning bargain once he finds that his wife Michele can no longer conceive. For Jeff, the next daybreak becomes not only the beginning of a new day, but the end of an old life. He wakes into a world where his wish has been fulfilled. He and Michele have their own children, but the event that enabled this change has forever altered them both. When Jeff discovers that he no longer paints, indeed that his artistic endeavors are stifled by insecurity, he sees himself a man turned bitter with anger and despair. \"Daybreak\" follows Jeff's struggle to discover what went wrong, as he uncovers personal demons and death on his own journey to damnation.",

    "synopsis": "Romy and Michele have been through it all, including being tortured by the Popular crowd when in high school. When they receive word of a 10 year reunion, they come to realize their lives aren't as impressive as they'd like them to be. Instead of staying home they go to the reunion with business outfits, cell phones, and one heck of a bogus success story. Best friends since they were children, single, unambitious late twenty-somethings Romy White, a Jaguar dealership cashier, and unemployed Michele Weinberger are roommates living in Los Angeles, which, in and of itself, they see as being a good life compared to the alternative of living in their backwater hometown of Tuscon. They are both stereotypical ditsy blonds, although Romy is slightly more aware than perpetually happy Michele, who has no idea that they were not popular when they were in school. Their high school life included being the butt of jokes by the popular clique led by Christie Masters, Romy being in love with Christie's boyfriend, jock Billy Christianson, and back brace wearing Michele being pursued by ultimate geek Sandy Frink (nicknamed the Frinkazoid) which did not sit well with bright but always angry, chain-smoking Heather Mooney who was in love with Sandy herself. When Romy runs into Heather, who is now a successful Jaguar-driving entrepreneur but is still a chain-smoking, angry woman, Romy discovers that their ten year reunion from Sagebrush High School in Tuscon is upcoming in two weeks. Romy and Michele decide to go, but Romy believes that they have to have the perfect lives to show up especially Christie and that group. That perfect life includes being professionally successful which for Michele means getting not just a job but a good job, losing some weight and having an equally perfect man in each of their lives. Barring any of these things actually happening in two weeks, they have to come up with the perfect stories to perpetuate that great life. In doing so, Romy and Michele may put their own friendship to the test as they try to become people they are not. Romy and Michele are two former schoolmates who have also been roommates for ten years after the time they graduated, and their lives are far from successful, they can't even get a date. As the 10-year class reunion approaches they try to do something to make an impression on other former schoolmates and finally decide to act as though they are very rich business women who invented Post-Its.",

    "synopsis": "Professional Golfer, Kenny Monahue, likes selling fake Rolexes and placing side bets more than playing on the PGA tour. When he gets suspended from playing professional golf for starting a fistfight during a tournament, his money runs as low as his reputation. The only job he can get is working on the grounds crew at a country club. Kenny is paired with Eric Beemer, a man with special needs. Eric is somewhat of a golf savant, tending the course with an otherworldly ability. While Kenny begrudgingly accepts his new job, he tries to help Eric in the department of love. After many failed attempts to set Eric up, Eric falls for Emma who has special circumstances of her own. Seth Smullen, Kenny's agent, finds a way for Kenny to play for money while suspended. He enters Kenny into a small tournament in South America. Eric does not want Kenny to go. He's afraid Kenny will fall back into his old ways on and off the golf course. Kenny goes anyway and the results are disastrous. Upon returning to the country club and Eric's forgiveness, Kenny gets back on track only to find out that the PGA caught wind of his playing a tournament. He now faces a possible lifetime ban from the PGA. Kenny tailspins in an endless bottle of vodka and consequently misses Eric and Emma's engagement party. Alone, Kenny faces the PGA board and admits his faults and that he's ruined his chance to play golf professionally again. Walking out of the hearing, Kenny finds Eric who has given testimony on Kenny's behalf to keep him on the tour. After Eric and Emma get married, Kenny opens the letter from the PGA about his fate and asks Eric if he'd like to be a caddie.",

    "synopsis": "This is the retelling of the events of the weekend of April 23rd 2004. Three young, sexy girls go into the woods on a camping trip to a family cabin. The local forest Ranger had warned them about an old Hermit who lives in the woods, so when two young, great looking guys show up, the girls are nervous. Anxiety turns to attraction after they get to know each other. The next day, someone is still watching them. The Hermit shows up and threatens them, telling them to leave or die. That night, the gruesome murders begin and we realize that the victims are little more than food for this Ňwatcher in the woods. Snares, long sharp knives, bear traps and branches all make for perfect ways to end the lives of these young adults who are camping on haunted ground. In the end, the line between friendship and terror is blurred when we realize the murderer is an evil spirit who befriends then murders his prey.",

    "synopsis": "In the early days of the system, that came to be known as Capitalism, political economists of all stripes struggled to understand the laws that govern the flow of capital - and of Capitalism's related activities. As a result, a critical assessment and sketchy understanding of how Capitalism worked began to emerge. But in recent times, as the system, and the world, has grown a hundredfold more complex we have veered away from the pursuit of any clear, critical understanding of the phenomenon. Economic departments in most major universities in the English-speaking world have abolished courses in the history of Economic and political economy. We are left with incomprehensible mathematical models whose relevance to the real world is hotly disputed. We were told very little about Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus yet their names have been used to give legitimacy to contemporary economic activities. To further obscure the issues, this Ť econo speak ť has been supplemented by endless superficial news reports, pundits discussions and analysis filled with clichés and superficial information. Our series intends to puncture this veil of opacity to go beyond the current Ť econo- speak ť to re examine the ideas which have been used in the past 40 to reshape the world. Is today's economic crisis a temporary blimp on the road to progress or a symptom of a deeper crisis of the system as a whole? Can the big ideas of the at the heart of our Economic system help us understand today's economic crisis, or obscure it? And more importantly - can they show us a way out? Where does capitalism come from? Did it evolve through the normal course of our societies or was it born from theories elaborated by political changes and technologies? This 6 part series is an in-depth investigation shot in over 22 countries that challenges the fathers of capitalism and the established ideas and principles of the system.",

An implacable reflection on power and an atrocious portrait of the society in which those hangmen operate.",

Skip to the present day, and an archaeologist discovers a mummy from the village. Blissfully unaware that the mummy is, in fact, possessed by an evil spirit (naturally), he runs off, leaving his assistant alone. The mummy comes to life, kills her, and the evil spirit takes over her body. This evil spirit is now searching for Misa, who is protected by a survivor from the original massacre, known only as Saiga It is Misa's destiny to defeat this evil spirit, but she needs Saiga's help to do it.",

    "synopsis": "In the heart of North Dakota's formidable terrain, an oil boom brings both promise and foreboding. For some, the boom will be their saving grace, for others a devastating misfortune. In a rapidly industrializing landscape, newcomers and long-time residents find themselves in a struggling environment where stakes are high and the future is far from certain. In the great American West, two men are lead to reconsider their lives, given new economic opportunities. Thanks to new extraction techniques, namely hydraulic fracking, North Dakota has been undergoing an unprecedented oil boom for the last ten years, which has lead to drastic changes, both individual and social. The local \"homesteaders\" watch their traditional way of life fade away, whereas newcomers arrive in this blessed area searching for jobs and a better way of life. The future is uncertain for John Heiser, the unwitting witness of this \"gold rush\" of modern times and for Doug Wenner, hit by the economic crisis, who may find here an unexpected occasion for redemption. North Dakota, so far considered as remote, is rushed into the industrial era, forced to increase the number of drills and to welcome an ever-growing population where everyone must learn how to take their fair share of the Black Harvest.",

    "synopsis": "Every Tuesday morning, not far from the Grands Causses of the South Aveyron, France, whatever is the weather, at the day edge, a gigantic theater stage opens outdoor. A play takes place, where no text is written but where everyone knows his role on the fingertips. The actors, since distant times, have all the same suit: a black blouse and a cane. During this short lapse of time, they are going to confront themselves, to flee, to catch, to tap on the shoulder, to laugh and to have a row, to love and to hate themselves. These actors of a moment are the traders in cattle of the market of Laissac.",

Whey they approach their respective families for approval for marriage, both families reject this. But Tina's grandfather, who has a modern outlook towards life, proposes a \"trial marriage\" for two months where they will have to live within Anil's meagre means. They can spend the day together but at nights Anil returns to his home. Both Anil and Tina agree to this, as they are confident their love will overcome any challenges along the way. Their families are sceptical but agree to the arrangement. As expected, a lot of challenges do come the way of both Anil and Tina during this \"trial marriage\". Do they survive these ? Or do the harsh realities of \"married life\" finally bring both of them back to their \"practical\" senses ?",

    "synopsis": "Jeff Wall is one of the most important and influential photographers working today. His work played a key role in establishing photography as a contemporary art form. Jeff Wall describes his recent work as \"near documentary,\" a plausible account or a report on real or imagined encounters. Wall usually spends weeks painstakingly recreating these encounters and taking many pictures, from which he selects his final image in a critical process. His photographs are mainly displayed as backlit Cibachrome transparencies. In an interview with Sheena Wagstaff, Chief Curator at the Tate Modern, he said: Evaluation of quality is the core of the pleasure of the experience of art; the simultaneous pleasure of enjoying something intensely and of recognizing that it is a good work. I always judge my picture - daily, hourly, all the time. Even though it's disappointing to have to say \"that one is not good\", or \"not as good as that one\", it is still a pleasure to go through that process and experience a work afresh. Nothing has been as destructive to the condition of art as the idea that qualitative judgment is unimportant, and that art is important for cultural reasons. Art can only be important if it is good, because if it is good, it pleases us in ways we don't anticipate and don't understand, and that pleasure means something to us even if we can't specify what, exactly.",

A celebrated experimental photographer struggles with the loss of her intuitive genius as an unexpected aftermath of a physical change; an intellectual monk confronting a complex ethical dilemma with a long held ideology, has to choose between principle and death; and a young stockbroker, following the trail of a stolen kidney, learns how intricate morality could be. These disparate characters manifest philosophical dilemmas in their personal lives, but their narratives converge to reveal an even larger fabric of connections, meaning, beauty, existence and death in a delicately poetic finale.",

    "synopsis": "Three and a half days before the most mysterious day of the past one hundred years, a man convinces his family to travel deep into the eerie Louisiana swamps to finally solve the mystery of a unique series of numbers. Obsessed with the number 11 and the strange connection it has with his deceased father, Sam convinces his wife Maria, his two children Sammy and Alexandra, and his best friend Michael to drop everything and follow him on a journey to find an isolated fishing camp where he believes that all of his questions will finally be answered. When the group eventually make their way down to a tiny remote village in the heart of the Cajun bayou and miles off the main road, they meet an old fisherman who tries to discourage Sam from continuing his journey into the misty swamps.

Seen as a sign of adequacy, virility and manliness, those lucky enough to be well endowed are heralded by both sexes and all sexualities. As women have always maintained, and men have always thought, size matters, but not in the way that most of us imagine. Sometimes having a Big Johnson is a bigger problem than you'd guess. Meet the men, including the man claiming to have the World's biggest penis, who reveal there is a bittersweet side to nature's gift, and who lift the veil on a taboo subject and to show the reality of what it's like to have what all men dream of.",

After a booking mishap involving a Christian fund raiser, he decides he's hit rock bottom. Seeking to shake things up, he moves to L.A. where his luck changes overnight. Thanks less to his inept manager than to a wild case of mistaken identity, he falls backwards into a string of packed gigs, a record deal and even the promise of love. But he who lives by the whimsy of show business dies by it, and reality hits him like a fist in the face: an innocent miscommunication over a bagel brands him a neo-Nazi in the world of tabloid journalism. Luckily, somewhere between rock bottom and nowhere lies the perfect terrain for his dark and hilarious songs.",

While it demands our precious time and finances it often shakes the very foundations of our instincts, emotions and patience. With so much on the line it's hardly surprising good contractors and handymen are universally coveted while the vast majority face suspicion or distrust. Even less surprising is how perfectly suited and increasingly popular this \"good guys/bad guys\" industry is for television - particularly shows that hinge on a handyman's craft or character, a homeowners money (or dreams) or - most importantly it seems - a credible and charismatic hosts' ability to help the viewer sift through it all. These days the best of them are a triple-threat package: on-camera guide, story protagonist and series defining character or \"brand\". In this, HGTV's inaugural HANDYMAN SUPERSTAR CHALLENGE, our goal is to find Canada's next great home reno or repair show \"package\" - a real handyman with real skill, real integrity and real enough star potential to host their very own show. Over the course of seven action-packed, half-hour episodes the HANDYMAN SUPERSTAR CHALLENGE will be a fun and revealing look at both what it takes and who it takes to \"make it\" in this unique television genre. To help us decide popular HGTV hosts Mike Holmes and Jim Caruk will form two-thirds of our judging panel. Judge number three will be a top Toronto- based female casting agent.",

    "synopsis": "FAME: It's the American dream. The pinnacle by which success is measured. But beyond the glitz, the glamour, the million dollar lifestyles exists a dark side--one we rarely see, until it's too late. Part one of this two-part special exposes the dark side of Hollywood fame. Includes the tragic stories of Dana Plato, the Diff'rent Strokes TV star who struggled to survive outside the celebrity life; Rob Pilatus, who was emotionally destroyed when his Milli Vanilli band was exposed as a sham; and Anna Nicole Smith, who dreamed of becoming the next Marilyn Monroe but whose life ended in a nightmare of drug abuse.",

One night in her local bar she bumps into Marcel, an almost forgotten acquaintance. Just after he recognises her Lotte takes flight, finding refuge in the flat of her friend Sabine. The following day, the events of the previous evening still grate on Lotte and she cannot seem to shake them off, even during her work at the hospital. A young girl, Greta, is brought in, Lotte takes care of her and a gentle affection develops between them. But this happiness is short-lived because, a little later, Lotte witnesses an encounter between Greta and Marcel. The three catch sight of each other and Lotte realises she will not be able to run away this time.",

To save him from further trouble his friend gives him a document that corroborates his strong loyalty to the current regime: the safe passage he thus gets helps, although inadvertently, the partisans in several occasions. Then the Allies come and, what else, they accuse him of being a collaborator, and arrest him. The friend comes to the rescue...",

Through an extraordinary adventure that unfolds in Labrador, Hawaii, and Alaska, they share the excitement, beauty and unknown mystery of a new world... a world still scarcely unchanged, where creatures live as they lived thousands of years ago, a world so close to our own, yet so different. The line between these two worlds is drawn only by the surface of the oceans that cover the planet. Beneath this line is another world, an underwater world that is home to the last giants on earth... The passionate people, with three distinct backgrounds, share an adventure that was the fulfillment of a dream: to explore the mysterious world of the humpback whale. The first member of the trio is renowned Canadian painter Allen Smutylo. The second, Gilles Couët, is an adventurer. The third, Jean Lemire, is a scientist. Each brings his own training, experience, and vision. They came together, inspired by art, adventure and nature. The challenge then was to give expression to the resulting experience. Through this remarkable journey with whales, we follow the entire process of inspiration and creation. Beneath each line drawn by the artist is a real experience helps us to understand the emotions within. The Last Frontier is an impassioned look at nature, with breathtaking footage, where art, science and adventure blend together to express the full range of emotions generated by an adventure in another world, a world beneath the line.",

Despite the blow it would deal to their football program, the team unanimously voted to decline the invitation and held tight to their motto - \"Undefeated, Untied, Uninvited.\"",

    "synopsis": "Kebi, Serge, Musa, and Hector come from different parts of the world, but they have one thing in common: they have all been tortured in their home countries. Contrary to their expectations, they survived the torture and they now all live in Finland. Life goes on, but with certain limitations. The torture has had a severe impact on them. It has affected their minds, self-esteem and sleep. And the rise of an anti-immigration atmosphere in Finland does not help the situation. Kebi's future is uncertain. He is seeking asylum and living in a refugee reception centre. He is struggling with depression, insomnia and an alcohol problem. In addition, he has been beaten up by local youngsters and the case is about to go to court. Serge has a residence permit and he is attending therapy sessions for torture victims, but he feels that he cannot heal without his children. His family reunification process is proceeding, and slowly his zest for life is coming back. Musa and his family have received asylum in Finland. As a husband and father, he feels that he is insensitive and coarse - his torture experiences have a stong effect on his family life. Hector, the oldest of the four, is a grandfather and a pensioner. Over the years, he has managed to channel his emotions through painting and his grim art has become more colourful. But even forty years after he was tortured, he is still suffering. In the film, the stories of the four men are interwoven into a common experience of what it is like to try to live on after being tortured.",

Through the eyes of the young actress we learn about the meaning of being an actress in Off Broadway today, about preserving an old art form like Yiddish theater and about the meaning of chasing your dreams to their limits. Inspired by the true story of an 86 year-old diva in New York City, who is forced to put together her own Yiddish theater company, and the magical friendship she forms with the ingénue cast in her play. Adapted from the acclaimed documentary \"Yiddish Theater: A Love Story.\"",

    "synopsis": "Recent legislation attempting to legitimize the use of internment camps to detain U.S. citizens in the event of an uprising or civil unrest has many people asking what nation they live in. In a country born out of political dissent, we watch our leaders in Washington slowly pass bills that label ordinary Americans as thought criminals and potential domestic terrorists for simply questioning the actions of their government. We see third party candidates and their impassioned supporters listed in secret government reports that call their allegiance into question and brand them as fanatics and extremists.    Senate committee hearings and official FBI documents further illustrate the mindset of our elected officials as they classify homeschoolers, gun rights activists and anti-abortionists as threats against the existing social and political order; by default creating an entire nation of radicals and revolutionaries - where everyone is a suspect... equally guilty until proven otherwise.  How has our government shown that they will deal with these people? The same way as every other totalitarian regime throughout history - marginalize their activities then lock them up. Prisons are being built; internment camps constructed and laws passed that deal severely with anyone who dares to step out of line or ask too many questions. Who are the potential domestic terrorists that will end up in these camps? Read the documentation for yourself and hear what our experts have to say. States rights take a front row seat in this new political thriller that is guaranteed to send shivers up your spine.

    "synopsis": "Counting Headz is a platform for stories that are often drowned out among the male voices in hip hop. This ground-breaking documentary reveals the position of South Africa's women today; their stories are mediated through the experiences of three major artists in South Africa's hip hop scene. MC Chi introduces the alleged contradiction of values between African and hip hop cultures. Is it possible to reconcile the two? Is it worth it to reconcile the two? Her questions thread together the obstacles encountered by fellow sistaz. DJ Sistamatic challenges a distorted portrayal of her image in the media. Candidly, she recounts her resistance to conform to female stereotypes as she continues to make a name for herself. Family relationships are tested when daughters step outside traditional roles; Graffiti artist Smirk works beyond her family's initial misgivings about her art and prepares to merge living hip hop and being a mother. Alternately, they are supported and contradicted by an all-female community of hip hop artists and activists from the locally respected MC, Cuba, to the internationally acclaimed crew, Godessa. Counting Headz is a collaboration, a labour of love, a celebration. But most importantly, it is a voice for these women's stories that are often left unheard.",

The phrase \"in flags or flitters\" is taken from 'Finnegans Wake' by James Joyce, Dublin's greatest writer, and a rare recording of his voice is used in the film. It is made from archive footage shot in the thirty years between approximately 1960 until around 1990, now preserved in the collections of the Irish Film Archive/Irish Film Institute and RTE. The documentary, which is not chronological and has no narrator, deals with the look and the built environment of the city (and county) of Dublin as well as its influence on art and artists.",

In pursuing their goals, Trudy and Luna find out a lot about themselves and the people they thought they knew. This film takes a satirical look at the world of showbiz and film making. Many stereotypes are confronted, but all with a lightly humourous touch. Luna wants to make it as an actor, Trudy, his flatmate, wants her project about the \"larger lady\" to get financed and into production. Unfortunately the world of showbiz isn't always very welcoming! \"My Life as a Bus Stop\" gently, and then sharply, pokes fun at the common attitudes, people, film festivals and arty shows that populate the world of the media and film making. Luna, girlfriend Marlene, Trudy and con artist Vic Young go on to discover not only a lot about the world of film making, but themselves too! Luna Sea is determined to make it as an actor. Unfortunately he's hampered by an unfortunate lack of talent. His flat mate Trudy is trying to get her film about the \"larger lady\" off the ground - but no one is interested. These two characters in a ripe position to be ripped off by con artist Vic Young.",
